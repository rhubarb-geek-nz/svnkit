Subversion is a leading and fast growing Open Source version control system. SVNKit brings Subversion closer to the Java world! SVNKit is a pure Java toolkit - it implements all Subversion features and provides APIs to work with Subversion working copies, access and manipulate Subversion repositories - everything within your Java application.
